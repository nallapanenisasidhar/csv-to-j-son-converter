This project has the CSV files and AWS Lambda code from the AWS Data Engineer Project tutorial. The Lambda function uploads the CSV data to S3, and AWS Glue is used to organize and clean the data so it’s ready to use. It’s a basic example of building a serverless data pipeline with S3, Lambda, and Glue, and you can connect it to Athena or Redshift to run queries.
